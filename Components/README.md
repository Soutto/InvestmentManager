# Pages Folder Patterns and Guidelines

This document outlines the standards and best practices for implementing and organizing code within the `Pages` folder of our Blazor application. These patterns are intended to maintain consistency, readability, and clarity in the codebase.

---

## General Structure
Each `.razor` and `.razor.cs` pair should be implemented with the following organization:

### Regions
Use regions in the `.razor.cs` files to structure the code logically and consistently. The recommended order is:

```csharp
#region Dependencies (Injected Services)

#endregion

#region Properties

#endregion

#region Fields

#endregion

#region Protected Methods

#endregion

#region Private Methods

#endregion
```

#### Region Details
1. **Dependencies (Injected Services)**:
   - Place all `@inject` services or other dependencies here.
   - These should include services required for the functionality of the component.

2. **Properties**:
   - These are variables used in both the `.razor` and `.razor.cs` files.
   - Use `protected` access modifiers to indicate shared usage.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     protected string Title { get; set; }
     ```

3. **Fields**:
   - These are variables used exclusively within the `.razor.cs` file.
   - Use `private` access modifiers to encapsulate their scope.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     private int _counter;
     ```

4. **Protected Methods**:
   - Methods that are accessible from the `.razor` file.
   - Use `protected` to signify intended shared functionality.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     protected void IncrementCounter() {
         _counter++;
     }
     ```

5. **Private Methods**:
   - Methods used solely within the `.razor.cs` file.
   - Keep these private to avoid unnecessary exposure.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     private string FormatTitle(string input) {
         return input.ToUpper();
     }
     ```

---

## Naming Conventions
- Follow **PascalCase** for public and protected members (e.g., `Title`, `IncrementCounter`).
- Use **camelCase** for private fields, prefixed with an underscore (e.g., `_counter`).
- Match filenames with component names for clarity.
  - Example: `MyComponent.razor` and `MyComponent.razor.cs`.

---

## Additional Guidelines
- Avoid placing business logic directly in `.razor` files. Keep logic confined to `.razor.cs` files whenever possible.
- Use comments to explain non-intuitive code or decisions.
- Ensure each component has a clear and focused responsibility. Consider splitting large components into smaller, reusable parts.
- Test your components thoroughly, ensuring properties and methods function as expected.

By adhering to these patterns and guidelines, we aim to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
